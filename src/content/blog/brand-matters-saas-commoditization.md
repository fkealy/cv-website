The barrier to building SaaS just hit zero.

[AI coding assistants deliver 20-55% productivity gains](https://www.bettercloud.com/monitor/saas-industry/) according to a 2024 GitHub study. No-code platforms let anyone ship without writing code. A production-ready SaaS that [used to cost $35K-400K now costs $5K-8.5K](https://www.raftlabs.com/blog/saas-app-development-cost/) with AI assistance.

Here's what that means: your competitor can clone your product in a weekend.

Horizontal SaaS is saturated. Dozens of viable alternatives exist in every category, most with generous free tiers. Switching costs are measured in days, not months. And your beautiful UI/UX? AI agents bypass it entirely. They consume raw APIs and data, not pretty dashboards.

I saw this building [Yotpoint](https://yotpoint.com). When we added scheduling tools, Instagram became a graveyard of identical ads: "scheduling, invoicing, payments for contractors." Same features, different logos. Everyone burning cash on paid ads to differentiate the indistinguishable.

The wake-up call: "tools for trades" isn't even a niche. It's a huge market that attracted hundreds of competitors. The real niches live inside. HVAC scheduling with inventory tracking. Invoicing for solo electricians.

A January 2026 report from [ThinkingTechStocks on SaaS market dynamics](https://www.thinkingtechstocks.com/p/the-great-software-correction-of) put it bluntly: "In 2026, being 'known' isn't enough; you must be trusted." Brand, community, and ecosystem are what's left when product features become table stakes. When products commoditize, trust is everything.

The question isn't "how fast can we ship features?" It's "who do we serve, and why do they trust us?"

Because when anyone can build your product, the only thing that matters is why someone would choose yours.

What's your answer?
