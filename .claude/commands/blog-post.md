Research the latest AI and SaaS industry news and help me write a personal blog post about: $ARGUMENTS

## Process:

### 1. Research Phase
- Use WebSearch to find the latest AI/SaaS industry news, trends, and developments related to the topic
- Focus on recent (2026) news, thought leaders' takes, and emerging patterns
- Identify 3-5 key insights or angles worth exploring

### 2. Interview Phase
Conduct a conversational interview to extract personal insights. Use AskUserQuestion to ask 3-4 questions:

**Round 1 - Initial Perspective:**
- What's your initial take on this news/trend?
- Have you experienced this personally in your work?
- What surprised or interested you most about this development?

**Round 2 - Deeper Dive (based on their answers):**
- Dig deeper into their most interesting point
- Ask about specific examples, stories, or contrarian views
- Explore practical implications for their audience

**Round 3 - Refinement:**
- If answers feel generic, ask: "Can you give me a specific example?" or "What would you tell a friend about this over coffee?"
- Push for authentic, personal angles

### 3. Writing Phase
Create 3 blog post variations (under 300 words each):

**Variation 1:** Personal story-led (starts with their experience)
**Variation 2:** Industry insight-led (starts with the news/trend)
**Variation 3:** Contrarian or hot-take angle

**Rules for all variations:**
- Strong hook in first 2 sentences
- Weave in personal perspective from interview
- Include specific examples or data from research
- End with a thought-provoking question or clear takeaway
- Conversational, authentic tone (not promotional)
- No emoji bullet points, minimal hashtags
- Under 300 words each

### 4. Humanize & Save
- Run each variation through the humanizer skill to remove AI-sounding language
- Save all 3 variations to `/output/blog/drafts/YYYY-MM-DD-topic-slug.md` with metadata:
  ```markdown
  ---
  topic: [topic]
  date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
  research_sources: [key URLs]
  ---

  ## Variation 1: [Title]
  [content]

  ## Variation 2: [Title]
  [content]

  ## Variation 3: [Title]
  [content]
  ```

### 5. Present & Iterate
- Show all 3 variations to the user
- Ask which resonates most and if they want to refine further
- If needed, ask 1-2 more interview questions to strengthen the chosen variation

## Example Interview Flow:

Topic: "AI agents in customer support"

Q1: "What's your hot take on AI agents replacing human customer support reps?"
Q2: "Have you personally dealt with an AI support agent recently? What happened?"
Q3: "If you were building a SaaS product today, where would you draw the line between AI and human support?"
[If answer is vague] Q4: "Give me a specific scenario - like a support ticket you handled - where AI would've failed."

## Success Criteria:
- Post feels authentically "Freddie" - personal, specific, opinionated
- Backed by real industry insights from research
- Under 300 words but still substantive
- Could spark conversation or debate
- Readers learn something new AND get a personal perspective
