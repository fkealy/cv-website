title: "Building features isn't a moat anymore"

I saw the same Instagram ad ten times in one day. "Scheduling and invoicing for contractors." Different logos, identical features.

What used to take months to build now takes a weekend and a Claude Code subscription. A 2024 GitHub study found AI assistants speed up developers by 20-55%. Anyone can build your features now.

## Brand is what's left

When your competitor can clone your product that fast, features stop mattering. What matters is who you're building for and whether they trust you.

Building [Yotpoint](https://yotpoint.com), we learned this the hard way. We could build scheduling tools for trades, but so could everyone else. The Instagram ad wall proved that.

Our brand narrative became clearer when we focused on who we serve: yacht management companies coordinating sensitive trade networks. Security-first platform they can trust. That's a different story than "scheduling and invoicing."

## Getting your narrative out there

You can't compete on features when features are free. You compete on understanding a specific problem for specific people.

Yacht management companies care about security and reliability. That's our narrative. Not "we have more features" but "we understand your risk."

The question isn't what you build. It's who you serve and why they'd trust you over twenty identical alternatives.

Your brand narrative is how you answer that. Or so I think anyway. Make it specific. Make it matter to someone real.
