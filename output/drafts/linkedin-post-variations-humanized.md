## Variation 1: The Velocity Shift

I shipped three features yesterday that would've taken me a week two months ago.

I didn't get better at coding. Claude Code just changed what building alone feels like.

I've always done everything myself—frontend, backend, deployment, the occasional CSS nightmare. The problem was never running out of ideas. It was running out of hours. You context-switch enough times and eventually you just stop making progress.

Now I'm basically pairing with an AI that knows my codebase. It reads my files, remembers my patterns, figures out what needs updating. I'm not sitting there asking "wait, where did I put that config" or "how does this hook into the auth flow again."

Three features in a day. A week ago that would've been my entire weekend, assuming I didn't get derailed debugging something unrelated.

I keep thinking about how many side projects died because I couldn't ship fast enough to stay motivated. The gap between "this could be cool" and "this is deployed" was just too wide.

What kills your momentum when you're building something solo?

## Variation 2: Learning Curve, Compressed

I debugged a React Server Component issue in 20 minutes yesterday. Two months ago that would've eaten my entire evening and half of Stack Overflow.

Claude Code doesn't just fix the bug. It explains why it happened in the first place.

I've been using it for about two months now and my debugging sessions have turned into these weird mini tutorials. I'm getting actual explanations of framework internals I'd normally never look at—not because I don't care, but because I'm usually too deep in "just make it work" mode to stop and learn.

When you're building solo you can't really specialize. I need to be okay at backend stuff, decent at deployment configs, good enough at accessibility, passable at performance optimization. The learning curve is massive and I'm always behind on something.

But when the AI can say "your Astro view transition broke because of this event lifecycle thing" and actually show me what's happening, I'm learning the framework at the same time I'm fixing my code.

I'm probably understanding my stack better now than I did after a year of just building with it.

Which part of your stack still feels like a black box to you?

## Variation 3: The Indie Dev Advantage

Big teams have process. Indie developers have speed. And we just got faster.

Claude Code is changing what solo builders can pull off. Not by replacing us—I'm still writing the code. But it removes so much friction between "I should build this" and "okay it's deployed."

No meetings about implementation details. No waiting two days for someone to review my PR. No explaining context to three different people. Just me and the terminal and an AI that actually knows what I'm working on.

The shift in my workflow is hard to describe. I spend way less time on config files and migration scripts and test boilerplate. That stuff still happens, it just doesn't take up my entire Tuesday night anymore.

More time on the problems that actually matter. The UX decisions. The features that make this project mine instead of generic.

I think this is the weird advantage indie devs have in 2026. We're small enough to move fast, and now we have tools that make us faster instead of trying to slow us down with enterprise workflows.

I shipped more last month than I did in the previous three combined.

What did you build this week?
