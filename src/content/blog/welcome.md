I rebuilt my website. The old one was just static HTML, which was fine, but it didn't really reflect what I'm doing anymore.

## Why bother?

Over the last couple years, I've gone from being a developer who works on other people's stuff to actually building my own things. That shift feels important enough to warrant a site that shows it.

Right now I'm co-founding [Yotpoint](https://yotpoint.com), a superyacht marketplace. Before that I built [Latch Log](https://latchlog.pages.dev) (helps new parents track breastfeeding) and [Emotional Scripture](https://emotionalscripture.pages.dev/) (connects emotions with scripture).

These are all pretty different but the thread is the same. Find a problem, build something to fix it.

## The stack

I went with [Astro](https://astro.build), [Bun](https://bun.sh), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). Astro is stupid fast for content sites. Bun makes dev feel instant. Tailwind means I can iterate quickly without fighting CSS.

At Yotpoint we use Next.js, Tailwind, and serverless AWS. This felt like a good lighter-weight version for a personal site.

## What's coming

I want to write about:
- How I'm building Yotpoint from scratch
- Interesting technical problems I run into
- Product decisions and why they matter
- The weird balance between making something technically good and actually useful

That's it. If you're building stuff too, let's connect on [GitHub](https://github.com/fkealy) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/freddie-kealy-140b05b5/).
